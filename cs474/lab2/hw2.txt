HW 2 
<For experimental results see experimental.pdf | please read README first>
Q1: 
	For the voting records dataset the rules make sense to me. In particular
	what is most interesting is the rules that are missing from this tree. These
	records show a democrat majority house of representatives under a republican 
	president (Ronald Regan-1984). If the political climate was as dysfunctional 
	then as it is now then it doesn't surprise me that the nodes that ended up 
	in the tree had to do with health-care, business, the budget, and weapons. 
	Those are still divisive issues along party lines like they are today. It 
	doesn't surprise me that something titled "handicapped infants" didn't have a 
	big divide along party lines. 

	For the cancer dataset it is very easy to understand why the uniformity of
	cell size, the uniformity of cell shape, and clump thickness ended up being 
	nodes in the tree. Cancer cells tend to vary in cell size, shape, and clump
	together in multilayer (thick), while benign cells tend not to vary as much in
	shape, or size, and tend to group in mono-layers (thin). These categories seem 
	to be clearly divergent between the two groups so it makes sense that they 
	became nodes in the tree.

Q2:

	p1 : 96.0526
	p2 : 94.382
	p3 : 97.8022
	p4 : 94.9495
	p5 : 97.4026

	mean : 96.1178
	std_deviation : 1.48913
	95 % confidence interval: 96.1178 +/- 1.960 * (1.48913/ sqrt(5)) 
		= [94.8125, 97.4231]

	Trees:
		Please see folds [0..4] (corresponding to [p1..p4]) of the problem #2
		section of experimental.pdf
		------------------

	Analysis:
	
	<Prompt>Do the ﬁve trees diﬀer with each other and with the tree 
		constructed using all the data?
	
	Yes, they do. I have included all five trees and the original tree for your
	observation. The five trees do have some differences. Sometimes they have 
	different nodes compared to the full tree, some have the same nodes at 
	different heights. This is because the training sets were random subsets 
	of the full training set. When you train with different data it makes 
	sense that the tree is different. 

Q3:
	p1: 97.8417 %
	p2: 94.2857 %
	p3: 93.3333 %
	p4: 96   %
	p5: 95  %
	
	mean : 95.2921 %
	std_deviation : 1.72747
	95 % confidence interval: 95.2921 +/- 1.960 * (1.72747/ sqrt(5)) 
		= [93.7779, 96.8063]

	Analysis:
	
	<Prompt>Do the ﬁve trees diﬀer with each other and with the tree 
		constructed using all the data?
	
	Yes. The five trees once again differ from one another for the same reasons
	as previously stated. Different data builds a different tree. What's more 
	interesting is that the nodes that are similar between the five trees are
	most likely the most important attributes to look at when determining 
	malignant vs. benign cancerous tumors. 
	
Q4:
	<House Votes Dataset> : 96.3218 % accuracy 
	<Breast Cancer Dataset> : 93.9914 % accuracy 
	
	Analysis:
	After 5-fold cross validation and missing value replacement the mean 
	accuracy was well within the 95% confidence range we established. 
	Therefore the change from missing data to filling in that data was not 
	significant.
