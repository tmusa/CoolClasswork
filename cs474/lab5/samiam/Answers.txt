Q:  What is the probability that the cow is infected in day k for k from 1 to 5
U:  To answer this question I created the network in Cow.net then I set the 
	values of the test nodes 
		{(test1), (test2), (test3), (test4), (test5)} 
	to  { positive, positive, negative, positive, positive} 
	as given in the problem statement. Then I showed all the monitors and used
	that to report the values in query mode.
A:	Where k is the day's number:
	k | % chance cow is infected
	1 | 24.39							/* P(day1=infected | evidence) */
	2 | 27.42							/* P(day2=infected | evidence) */
	3 | 20.79							/* P(day3=infected | evidence) */
	4 | 48.58							/* P(day4=infected | evidence) */
	5 | 49.52							/* P(day5=infected | evidence) */

Q:	What is the most likely states of the cow’s infection over the five days
U:	I thought of this as an MPE problem. So given the test evidence what is the
	most likely values of all the days. In query mode to solve this all you 
	can instantiate the values and click MPE.
A:	Where k is the day's number:
	k | most likely state of cow's infection
	1 | clean
	2 | clean
	3 | clean
	4 | clean
	5 | clean
	
	Also:
	P(mpe | evidence) = 0.449030275
	P(mpe, e)         = 0.000005884

Q:	What is the most likely states of the cow’s infection over the last three 
	days
U:	I thought this was an MAP problem. So given the test evidence what is the
	maximum a posterior for the last three days {(day3), (day4), (day5)}? To
	solve this problem we have to enter the variable selection menu, select
	the three days, then click the MAP button. (Both within the tools menu)
A:	Where k is the day's number:
	k | most likely state of cow's infection
	3 | clean
	4 | clean
	5 | clean
	
	Also:
	These are the probabilities using the exact calculations
	P(map | evidence) = 0.494214831
	P(map, evidence)  = 0.000006476

/*Additional Discussion*/
D:	These accurate tests could were more likely to be wrong because of the 
	prior probability of infection on day 1 being so low. For example when
	the prior probability is set to .01 all the days are predicted to be 
	"infected".
