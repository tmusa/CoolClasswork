[compile&run]

Step 1:
Confirm that the directory structure is correct. 
There should be one folder inside the top level folder ('naive_bayes_tmusa')
titled 'naive_bayes' inside that folder there should be the source files 
{'NaiveBayes.java', 'Document.java', 'NewsGroup.java'}

when you unzip the zip file the structure may be 

/naive_bayes_tmusa/naive_bayes_tmusa/naive_bayes
                   ^
if the structure is like that then you should run the commands from 
and place the csv files within the 'naive_bayes_tmusa' that is 
directly above the 'naive_bayes' folder 
(marked with a carrot in the path above)


You will absolutely need to put the files csv files into the folder
'naive_bayes_tmusa' that is above the 'naive_bayes' folder. 
I did not submit copies of those files because I assume you may test 
with different files. 

Step 2:
run the following command inside the directory 'naive_bayes' to compile the
code:

javac *

Step 3:
Copy the following files:

{vocabulary.txt map.csv train_label.csv train_data.csv 
test_label.csv test_data.csv}

into the folder directly above the 'naive_bayes' folder 
(top level folder of download)

Step 4:
From the top level folder run the following command to run the program:

java naive_bayes.NaiveBayes vocabulary.txt map.csv train_label.csv train_data.csv test_label.csv test_data.csv

It is important that the files are in the correct order and that the command
is run with java naive_bayes.NaiveBayes because the main file is in the package
'naive_bayes'. 

If you would like assistance with steps 1-4 please contact me at my email

Step 5:
This program will output to the terminal the required output described in the 
lab1.pdf

Also it generates two files:
 accuracy.txt  | with the accuracy information that were outputed
 confusion.txt | with the confusion matricies that were outputed 

Use these files for reviewing the data after the code has finished running. 
The labreport for this lab is in labreport.txt just pop that open and start 
reading.

[notes]
The bayesian estimator is implemented pretty much exactly as described in the 
lab1 pdf

The MLE estimator is implemented primarily like the described in the pdf except
that since we are calculating the logs of the estimation I needed to handle the
zero estimation issue. For that purpose I looked to the sum of multiplications
formula for the MLE estimator and realized that in that formula a single zero 
estimation results in a zero result. Which is what I have my estimator imitate.
In the situation that all the groups recieve a zero liklihood under the MLE 
then I randomly guess. 

The random guess is weighted using the information about the priors, so groups
with larger priors will have a better chance of being choosen. 

During my own testing I found this to be the best option and gives me a
roughly 10% accuracy.  

Also I tested the training data for fun using the MLE estimator and I got 99%
accuracy. I got 95% accuracy with the bayesian. 

The only thing I regret is that I couldn't get the matrix to print out evenly!

Thanks for grading!
